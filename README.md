# Introduction
Harry Pitter Patter Potter is an exhibit that seeks to emulate the notion of interactive portraits present in the Harry Potter Universe. The viewer can interact with Professor Snape and the Fat Lady based on her proximity to their portraits. Depending on whose portrait she stands in front of, the eyes of both respective figures will fixate in the general direction of the viewer. Additionally if she stands in front of the Fat Lady, the Fat Lady will  "speak" to the viewer by repeatedly opening and closing her mouth. However if the user stands in front of Snape, he will only continue to stare, which is emblematic of his taciturn personality as portrayed in the books. Overall the aim of this exhibit is to invoke surreal feelings in the viewer, as objects that should be lifeless and still are seemingly able to respond to their surroundings in realistic ways. 

# Materials and Tools
2 Posterboards
3 Servos
2 Rubber Bands
1 ESP32
2 Ultrasonic Sensors
2 Plastic Boards from Project Box Configurations

# Interactions
If the viewer stands in front of Snape’s portrait, his eyes will look straight ahead at the viewer, the Fat Lady’s eyes will flit to the side to stare at the viewer, and her mouth will be closed. If the viewer stands in front of the Fat Lady’s portrait, the Fat Lady’s eyes will look straight ahead at the viewer, Snape’s eyes will flit to the side to stare at the viewer, and the Fat Lady will begin “talking” to the viewer. If no one stands in front of either portrait, both the Fat Lady and Snape will stare straight ahead, and the Fat Lady will not be talking.

# Difficulties
Overall this project took a lot of energy to complete due to the fact that the aesthetic design was just as important as the functionings. Therefore I spent time making sure the figures looked representative of Snape and the Fat Lady. Only then could I work on the mechanical and electronic components.
A difficulty I encountered with the mechanical and electrical components was the fact that the fastening for the servo motor was incredibly loose and unreliable. Therefore it would sometimes decouple from the motor, disabling the movement of the eyes of the portraits. I had to use a lot of adhesive in order to prevent this from happening, but it wasn't always enough.

# Re-usability
This project also included reused items from past modules. Specifically the mounting I used for the ultrasonic sensors in this project was recycled from the enclosure designs for the ultrasonic sensors in my last project (the project box side panels). I also slightly re-implemented the pulley logic from my Module 4/5 project for the sliding mechanism (specifically the winding of the string by the servo).
