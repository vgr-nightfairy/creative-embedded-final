# Final Project: Harry Potter Portraits

# Introduction
Harry Pitter Patter Potter is an exhibit that seeks to emulate the notion of interactive portraits present in the Harry Potter Universe. The viewer can interact with Professor Snape and the Fat Lady based on her proximity to their portraits. Depending on whose portrait she stands in front of, the eyes of both respective figures will fixate in the general direction of the viewer. Additionally if she stands in front of the Fat Lady, the Fat Lady willÂ  "speak" to the viewer by repeatedly opening and closing her mouth. However if the user stands in front of Snape, he will only continue to stare, which is emblematic of his taciturn personality as portrayed in the books. Overall the aim of this exhibit is to invoke surreal feelings in the viewer, as objects that should be lifeless and still are seemingly able to respond to their surroundings in realistic ways. 

# Materials and Tools
2 Posterboards
3 Servos
2 Rubber Bands
1 ESP32
2 Ultrasonic Sensors
2 Plastic Boards from Project Box Configurations

# Difficulties
Overall this project took a lot of energy to complete due to the fact that the aesthetic design was just as important as the functionings. Therefore I spent time making sure the figures looked representative of Snape and the Fat Lady. Only then could I work on the mechanical and electronic components.
A difficulty I encountered with the mechanical and electrical components was the fact that the fastening for the servo motor was incredibly loose and unreliable. Therefore it would sometimes decouple from the motor, disabling the movement of the eyes of the portraits. I had to use a lot of adhesive in order to prevent this from happening, but it wasn't always enough.
